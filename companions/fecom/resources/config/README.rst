This file reproduce the hardware mapping between a geiger cell and the anodic and cathodic channels

The file must respect some rules. The cell number must be from 0 to 35 and the order must not be changed !

On a board, you have 54 channel / Feast and there is 2 Feasts per board. The total channel on a board is 108.

The channel rule for the mapping is : Feast number (0-1) * 54 + Channel. A channel is unique between 0 and 107

Ex : FEAST 1 CHANNEL 12 -> Channel = 66 (in the actual mapping - see the SNDER p30-31, this is the anodic channel of the cell #22)
