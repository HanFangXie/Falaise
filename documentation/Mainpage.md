Falaise is the software system for the SuperNEMO experiment. These

usage guides for the core applications.

Getting Started

at present Falaise is only supported on POSIX platforms, and even here
not all variants are guaranteed to work!

- [Falaise](@ref falaiseman) man page overview of the toolkit.
- [FLSimulate](@ref usingflsimulate) guide for using the Geant4 based simulation of the detector.
- [FLReconstruct](@ref usingflreconstruct) guide for reconstructing data output by the FLSimulate detector simulation.
  - [Writing plugin modules](@ref writingflreconstructmodules) for `flreconstruct`
  - [Working with Event Data in plugin modules](@ref workingwitheventrecords).
