Welcome to the Falaise Documentation {#mainpage}
====================================
Falaise is the software system for the SuperNEMO experiment. These
pages document the C++ API of the core Falaise library, together with
usage guides for the core applications.

Getting Started
===============
If you're reading this online and don't yet have Falaise installed, an
[Installation Guide](md_InstallationGuide.html) is available. Note that
at present Falaise is only supported on POSIX platforms, and even here
not all variants are guaranteed to work!

Core Applications
=================
For guides and man pages for the Falaise tools, see the following pages:

- [Falaise](md_Falaise.html "Falaise man page") man page overview of the toolkit.
- [FLSimulate](md_FLSimulate.html) guide for using the Geant4 based simulation of the detector.
- [FLReconstruct](md_FLReconstruct.html) guide for reconstructing data output by the FLSimulate detector simulation.

User Guides
===========
Documents detailing the use and design of Falaise may be found on
[Related Pages](pages.html).
