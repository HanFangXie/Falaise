Welcome to the Falaise Documentation {#mainpage}
====================================
Falaise is the software system for the SuperNEMO experiment. These
pages document the C++ API of the core Falaise library, together with
usage guides for the core applications.

Getting Started
===============
If you're reading this online and don't yet have Falaise installed, an
[Installation Guide](@ref installationguide) is available. Note that
at present Falaise is only supported on POSIX platforms, and even here
not all variants are guaranteed to work!

Core Applications

For guides and man pages for the Falaise tools, see the following pages:

- [Falaise](@ref md_Falaise) man page overview of the toolkit.
- [FLSimulate](@ref md_FLSimulate) guide for using the Geant4 based simulation of the detector.
- [FLReconstruct](@ref md_FLReconstruct) guide for reconstructing data output by the FLSimulate detector simulation.

User Guides
