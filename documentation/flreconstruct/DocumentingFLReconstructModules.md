Introduction {#documentingflrecontrustmodules_introduction}
============
As we saw in [the tutorial on writing custom modules for FLReconstruct](@ref md_WritingFLReconstructModules),
it is easy to make parameters of the module configurable at run time
through the ASCII text `datatools::multi_properties` pipeline script.
However, this creates an issue for the user of your module in finding
out what parameters your module exposes for configuration, what their
purpose is, and what types/values they may take. In this tutorial we
show how to integrate your module with the
`datatools::object_configuration_description` system.
