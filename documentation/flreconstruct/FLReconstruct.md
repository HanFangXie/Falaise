The FLReconstruct Application
=============================
FLReconstruct's task is to read data from an output file generated by
the SuperNEMO simulation or detector, perform reconstruction on each event
in the data, and write the reconstructed data to and output file.
It uses a pipeline architecture for event processing, the pipeline
is constructed as a sequence of "modules", the sequence of modules being
selected by the user (i.e. you) at runtime. Falaise provides a standard
set of modules, and you can write you own custom modules which
FLReconstruct can load at runtime via a plugin mechanism.

Here we present a brief overview of running FLReconstruct from the
command line, including examples of scripting the pipeline using builtin
modules. The more advanced topic of writing and using your own custom
modules is covered in [Writing FLReconstruct Modules](md_WritingFLReconstructModules.html).
