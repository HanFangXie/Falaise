VisuToy Falaise module's examples
=================================


List of available resources:

  * ``exo1`` : this example implements a basic pipeline that allows to
    interactively display  some SuperNEMO  event record loaded  from a
    data file produced by a simulation/reconstruction pipeline.
  * ``data`` : this directory contains some sample data files used by
    examples:

     * ``data/Se82_0nubb-source_strips_bulk_SD.brio`` :
       10 neutrinoless ^^82^^Se double beta decay
       simulated events generated from the bulk volume of the source strips
       in the SuperNEMO demonstrator.
     * ``data/Se82_0nubb-source_strips_bulk_SD-CD-TCD.brio`` :
       10 simulated events reconstructed through the mock calibration
       and the Mock Tracker Clusterizer module (built from the previous file).
