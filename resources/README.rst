Presentation
============

This is  the top  level directory  of all  resource files  provided by
Falaise.

Files:

 * ``README.rst`` : this file

Subdirectories:

 * ``config`` : the top directory for all official configuration files
   used   by  the   simulation,  reconstruction   and  data   analysis
   processing.   Our  convention  is  to   organize  the  files  in  a
   meaningfull  hierarchy, that  enables configuration  versioning and
   reusability  of  versioned  resource  files.  Note:  all  files  or
   directories of which  the names start with  an underscore character
   should not be published.

   All  files  should  be  accessible from  within  Bayeux  file  path
   utilities                               (``datatools::fetch_path``,
   ``datatools::fetch_path_with_env``...)  with the  following syntax:
   ::

     "@falaise:config/topic/subtopic/.../version/filename"

   Example for the  main configuration file for  the SuperNEMO virtual
   geometry: ::

     "@falaise:config/geometry/snemo/demonstrator/3.0/manager.conf"
